### Step-by-Step Guide for Changing the Root/Admin Password and Restricting Access to Only the Incident Response Account on FreeBSD

#### 1. Create an Incident Response Account

First, you need to create a new user account specifically for incident response purposes.

```sh
# Create a new user account named 'ir'
sudo pw user add ir -m -s /bin/sh

# Set a password for the 'ir' account
sudo passwd ir
```

#### 2. Grant the Incident Response Account Sudo Privileges

Add the incident response account to the `wheel` group to ensure it has administrative privileges.

```sh
# Add 'ir' to the wheel group
sudo pw group mod wheel -m ir

# Alternatively, add directly to the sudoers file if using sudo
echo "ir ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /usr/local/etc/sudoers.d/incidentresponse
```

#### 3. Change the Root Password

It's crucial to change the root password to ensure that unauthorized users cannot access the system.

```sh
# Change the root password
sudo passwd root
```

#### 4. Lock All Other User Accounts

To enhance security, lock all other user accounts except for the `ir` account.

```sh
# Get a list of all user accounts
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

# Lock all user accounts except 'root' and 'ir'
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do
    if [ "$user" != "root" ] && [ "$user" != "ir" ]; then
        sudo pw lock "$user"
    fi
done
```

#### 5. Verify No Other Users Can Access the System

Ensure that all other user accounts are locked and cannot log in.

```sh
# Check the status of user accounts
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do
    sudo passwd -S "$user"
done
```

#### 6. Look for Places That Might Alter User Passwords

To maintain security, monitor and secure places that could potentially alter user passwords.

- **Cron Jobs:**

```sh
sudo crontab -l
sudo ls /var/cron/tabs
```

- **Configuration Files:**

```sh
# Check for scripts and commands in common cron directories
sudo grep -r 'passwd' /etc/cron.*

# Check for scripts in /etc/profile.d, /etc/csh.cshrc, ~/.cshrc, ~/.profile
sudo grep -r 'passwd' /etc/profile.d/*
sudo grep -r 'passwd' /etc/csh.cshrc
sudo grep -r 'passwd' ~/.cshrc
sudo grep -r 'passwd' ~/.profile
```

- **Sudoers File:**

```sh
sudo visudo
```

- **Custom Scripts:**

```sh
# Check for custom scripts in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin, /opt, etc.
sudo find /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /opt -type f -exec grep -H 'passwd' {} \;
```

- **System Services:**

```sh
# Check for service files that might alter passwords
sudo grep -r 'passwd' /etc/rc.d/
sudo grep -r 'passwd' /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
```

#### 7. Secure and Monitor the System

- **Enable Audit Logging:**

FreeBSD uses `auditd` for auditing.

```sh
# Enable auditd
sudo service auditd onestart
sudo sysrc auditd_enable="YES"

# Add rules to log password changes
echo "-a always,exit -S all -F path=/etc/passwd -F perm=wa" | sudo tee -a /etc/security/audit_control
echo "-a always,exit -S all -F path=/etc/master.passwd -F perm=wa" | sudo tee -a /etc/security/audit_control
sudo service auditd restart
```

- **Regularly Review Logs:**

```sh
sudo praudit /var/audit/current
```

By following these steps, you can effectively change the root/admin password, restrict access to only the `ir` account, and monitor for any unauthorized changes to user passwords. This approach ensures a secure and controlled environment during an incident response.
