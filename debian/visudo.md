ure the integrity of your `sudoers` file and make sure only allowed users can perform `sudo` operations, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Check and Secure the `sudoers` File

#### 1. Inspect the `sudoers.tmp` File

When you run `visudo`, it creates a temporary file called `sudoers.tmp` to safely edit the `sudoers` file. To inspect this file while `visudo` is open, you can follow these steps:

1. Open `visudo`:
```sh
sudo visudo
```

2. In another terminal, list the contents of the `/etc` directory to find the `sudoers.tmp` file:
```sh
ls -l /etc/sudoers.tmp
```

3. Check the contents of `sudoers.tmp`:
```sh
sudo cat /etc/sudoers.tmp
```

4. Compare the contents with the actual `sudoers` file:
```sh
sudo diff /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.tmp
```

5. If the content is unexpected or contains unauthorized changes, discard the edit in `visudo` by exiting without saving:
```plaintext
:q!
```

#### 2. Ensure Only Allowed Users Can Perform `sudo`

1. Open the `sudoers` file using `visudo`:
```sh
sudo visudo
```

2. Edit the file to allow only specific users or groups to perform `sudo` operations. Here is an example configuration:
```plaintext
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# User-specific entries
allowed_user1 ALL=(ALL) ALL
allowed_user2 ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

3. Save and exit `visudo`:
```plaintext
:wq
```

#### 3. Restrict Access to the `sudoers` File

Ensure that the `sudoers` file has the correct permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications:

```sh
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
sudo chown root:root /etc/sudoers
```

#### 4. Monitor `sudoers` File for Changes

Set up monitoring to detect any unauthorized changes to the `sudoers` file:

1. Install `auditd` if not already installed:
```sh
sudo apt-get install auditd
```

2. Add an audit rule for the `sudoers` file:
```sh
sudo auditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers
```

3. Check the audit logs for any changes:
```sh
sudo ausearch -k sudoers
```

#### 5. Regularly Review `sudo` Logs

Regularly review the logs for `sudo` usage to ensure only authorized users are performing `sudo` operations:

1. Check the `auth.log` or `secure` log (depending on your distribution):
```sh
sudo grep 'sudo' /var/log/auth.log
```

2. Look for any unusual or unauthorized `sudo` usage entries.

### Summary

By following these steps, you can ensure the integrity of your `sudoers` file, restrict `sudo` access to only allowed users, and monitor for any unauthorized changes or usage. This will help you maintain a secure and controlled environment for `sudo` operations.
